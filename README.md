# Backend Engineering Challenge

This project aims at creating a simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output, which calculates a minute-by-minute moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites ###
In order to build and run this project, please ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:
