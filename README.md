# Backend Engineering Challenge Solution Submition

## How to run

To run the program, we simply need to type into the terminal

`python unbabel_cli.py --input_file <filename> --window_size <window_size>`

## Considerations and impressions

While Python is not the language I'm most comfortable with, I chose to do this challenge using it as it seemed the quickest and easiest language to solve a problem like this. I tried solving the problem using basic programming concepts and libraries that Python offers out of the box, staying away from other third-party libraries, such as numpy, that already has a function that calculates the moving averages of a given array. 

This was a really fun challenge to do. It was good to test my logic and problem solving capabilities, something that sometimes doesn't happen with other coding challenges.
